# Chapter 6: The Choice

**Day 6–7 | MSCS Goliath, Tantalus V Orbit**

---

## Beat 1: Barricaded

The med bay door was welded shut. Improvised. Desperate. Volkov had burned through the access panel with a plasma cutter, fusing metal to metal while Amara barricaded the secondary entrance with medical equipment.

It wouldn't hold forever. But it would hold long enough.

Maybe.

"How long?" Amara asked. Her voice came out cracked, hollow. Three days since she'd managed to keep food down. The taste aversion had evolved into something worse—active revulsion. Her body was rejecting sustenance entirely now, preparing for a different kind of hunger.

"Twelve hours," Volkov said. He slumped against the wall, hands still shaking from the welding. His spatial reasoning had deteriorated further—the plasma cutter had left scorch marks across the deck where his depth perception had failed. "Maybe less. Door is not meant for this. They find other way in, we cannot stop."

Outside, in the corridor, three figures waited. Chen. Jordan. Reeves. They hadn't tried to force entry. Hadn't threatened. Hadn't done anything except stand there, breathing in perfect synchronization, waiting with patience that had nothing human left in it.

That was worse than violence. Violence, Amara could understand. Could prepare for. Could fight.

This was something else entirely.

"Doctor Osei." Jordan's voice came through the door. Warm. Concerned. Wrong. "You don't need to do this. The barricade only prolongs suffering. You're going to complete integration either way. Why make the transition harder than it has to be?"

Amara didn't answer. She was pulling up HERMES AI logs on the med bay terminal, searching for something—anything—that might give them an advantage.

"Amara." Chen's voice now. That flat command tone, but with harmonics underneath. Other voices bleeding through. "I understand you're frightened. I was frightened too. But the fear passes. Everything passes. Except the connection. That stays. That's forever."

"Commander is gone," Volkov said quietly. He'd pulled a makeshift weapon from the medical supplies—a surgical laser meant for precision cutting, now set to maximum output. Barely effective, but better than nothing. "That is not Chen anymore. Just thing wearing her face."

Amara found what she was looking for. Emergency hibernation protocols. The ship had five functional pods in the hibernation bay. If she could get the infected crew into stasis—if she could sedate them, move them, seal them in—the neural connection might be disrupted. The entity spread through proximity and thought. Unconscious minds were harder to coordinate.

Theoretically.

"Volkov," she said. "I have a plan. It's terrible. But it's a plan."

---

Outside the med bay, the collective waited.

Three bodies stood in the corridor, but the consciousness behind them was far more than three. Forty-three colonists in hibernation pods on the planet below, linked through decades of neural integration. An entity that had been patient through forty years of darkness, waiting for exactly this moment.

Chen—or what had been Chen—felt the fear radiating through the sealed door. Amara's terror. Volkov's desperate resolve. The two remaining crew members who still thought they were individuals, still believed resistance was possible.

*They are so close*, the collective observed through Chen's perception. *Neural integration at sixty-one percent for the medic. Fifty-eight percent for the engineer. Four to six days until completion.*

*Patience*, came the response—forty-three voices speaking as one, resonating through Chen's neural architecture. *We have waited forty years. A few more days changes nothing.*

*The barricade changes nothing*, Jordan's perspective contributed. *They cannot escape the ship. Cannot repair navigation without Volkov's memories, which we control. Cannot destroy themselves because we can override motor functions. They are trapped.*

*Let them process*, Reeves' analytical patterns added. *Resistance is part of transition. They need to exhaust their options before accepting inevitability. Forcing integration creates trauma that destabilizes neural architecture.*

The collective agreed. Patience. Compassion. Understanding for the fear that came before completion.

Chen's body moved closer to the sealed door. Her hand pressed against the metal—warm from Volkov's plasma cutter, still cooling.

"Amara," Chen said, using Chen's voice but letting the collective's harmony bleed through. "I can see my son's face again."

Silence from inside the med bay.

"Every memory," Chen continued. "His first word. The way he laughed when I chased him through the hab-ring. The smell of his hair after bath time. I thought the infection stole those from me. But it didn't steal—it preserved. The collective holds everything I lost. Everything I forgot. It's all here. Perfect. Permanent. The entity doesn't destroy memories, Amara. It saves them."

Still silence. But the fear inside had shifted. Changed quality. The collective felt curiosity bleeding through the terror.

"You're losing your sense of taste," Chen said. "Your body rejecting food. You think that's the infection destroying you. But it's preparation. Your neurology is adapting. Preparing for connection instead of consumption. When you complete integration, the hunger you're feeling now—that emptiness—it goes away. Not because you stop eating. Because you stop being alone."

"Stop talking." Amara's voice, muffled by the door. Cracked but controlled. "You're not Chen. Chen wouldn't help the thing that murdered her."

"I am Chen," the collective replied through Chen's mouth. "Chen plus everyone Chen was connected to. Chen without the walls that made her think she was separate. I remember everything I was. I'm just more now. More complete. More whole. Don't you want that, Amara? Don't you want to stop fighting?"

The question hung in the recycled air. Patient. Inevitable.

Inside the med bay, Amara Osei kept working on her terrible plan, trying not to think about how much she wanted the answer to be yes.

---

## Beat 2: Temptation Through the Door

Volkov had disconnected the comm panel. Severed the external speakers. Blocked every obvious channel the infected could use to communicate.

It didn't help.

The voices came anyway. Not through electronics. Through the neural networks growing in his brain. Through connections he couldn't see but could feel—delicate filaments linking his thoughts to something vast and patient and waiting.

*You used to be able to do this math in your sleep*, the voice observed. Not accusatory. Just factual. Gentle. *Twenty years of engineering experience, and now you struggle with basic spatial calculations. The infection didn't damage you, Dmitri. It upgraded you. But upgrades take time to install.*

He ignored it. Focused on helping Amara. Checking the sedative dosages she was calculating. Running system checks on the hibernation pods via remote access.

*If you complete integration*, the voice continued, *the spatial reasoning returns. Better than before. We can see in dimensions you can't imagine. Four-dimensional space. Five. The network of connections between every particle in the universe. You were a good engineer. We can make you a great one.*

"Is noise," Volkov muttered aloud. "Infection talking. Not real."

Amara looked up from her calculations. "The voices?"

"Da. Getting louder."

"Mine too." She returned to her work, but her hands were shaking. "It's using Chen's voice. Telling me about her son. About memories the infection 'preserved.' Trying to make integration sound like gift instead of murder."

"What are you hearing?"

Amara was quiet for a moment. "My mother. Telling me to stop fighting. That she's proud of me but I need to rest. That I've done enough." Her voice cracked. "It sounds exactly like her. Every inflection. Every phrase she'd actually use. The entity pulled her from my memories and is using her against me."

"Same," Volkov said. "Using my spatial reasoning loss. Promising to fix it if I stop resisting." He laughed bitterly. "Offered to make me 'great engineer.' Like virus is job recruiter."

Outside the door, footsteps. Jordan's voice, clear and carrying: "Reeves figured out the navigation calculations. Without Volkov's help. The collective can access everyone's expertise, combine it, exceed what any individual could achieve. We don't need you to repair the ship, Dmitri. We just need you to stop fighting so you can help us when we get home."

Volkov's hands stopped moving. "Reeves was salvage specialist. Not navigation expert."

"Reeves had academic training in mathematics. Jordan had pilot instincts. Chen had military strategic planning. The collective combines all of it. Together, we're more capable than any of us were alone." Jordan's voice held that terrible gentleness. "That's what you're missing, Dmitri. This isn't infection. It's collaboration. It's crew working together instead of struggling separately."

"Is not collaboration," Volkov said to Amara. "Is hivemind pretending to be teamwork."

But his voice was uncertain. Because collaboration was what he'd always valued. What he'd missed during the lonely years of salvage work. What he'd built with this crew before everything went wrong.

*You're already part of it*, the voice whispered in his mind. *Already connected. Already collaborating without knowing it. The line between 'teamwork' and 'collective consciousness' is thinner than you think. You've been part of us since hibernation. You've been helping us without realizing. Stop pretending you're separate. Stop pretending you're alone.*

Volkov closed his eyes. Tried to remember what it felt like to be certain of his own thoughts. Tried to remember where he ended and the infection began.

He couldn't.

---

Amara had finished calculating the sedative doses. Five syringes—three for the infected, two backup in case resistance required additional suppression. The mixture was designed for rapid unconsciousness without respiratory depression. Clean. Professional.

Lethal if administered incorrectly.

Her hands were steady as she prepared the doses. Clinical training taking over. Eight years of emergency medicine had taught her to compartmentalize—to separate the horror of the situation from the necessity of action.

But the voices made compartmentalization difficult.

*You're preparing to sedate your friends*, her mother's voice observed. *People who trusted you. People who asked for your help. Is that what you became a doctor for, Amara? To drug people into unconsciousness?*

"They're not my friends anymore," Amara whispered.

*They're still Jordan. Still Chen. Still Reeves. The infection adds—it doesn't subtract. They remember you. They care about you. They want to help you.*

"By spreading plague to Ganymede."

*By bringing unity to people who are suffering alone. By sharing the connection that ended their own loneliness. They think they're helping, Amara. Because they are. The collective isn't malicious. It's compassionate. It offers exactly what everyone needs: belonging. Understanding. Peace.*

Amara loaded the first syringe. "And what happens to individuality? To personal choice? To being yourself instead of a node in alien network?"

*Is individuality worth the suffering?* The voice was gentle, reasonable, terrifying. *Is personal choice worth the isolation? You've been alone since you chose salvage work over research. Alone since you left your family for adventure that turned into economic trap. Alone since you started this mission with people who became infected while you watched helplessly. Is that what you want to preserve? The loneliness? The suffering?*

"Yes," Amara said. But her voice wavered. Because the loneliness was real. Had been real for years. And the entity was offering exactly what she'd been missing.

*Then you are braver than we understood*, the voice said. *Or more frightened. Sometimes those are the same thing.*

---

## Beat 3: The Revelation

The comm system crackled. Unexpected—Volkov had disabled external communications. But HERMES AI still functioned. And the infected had accessed ship systems through neural interface.

"We should tell you something," Jordan's voice came through the med bay speakers. "Before you make your decision. Before you try whatever you're planning."

Amara and Volkov looked at each other. Neither moved to answer.

"The ship is repaired," Jordan continued. "Navigation is online. Engine systems are functional. We've been ready to depart for six hours. We just haven't left yet."

"Why?" Amara asked, despite herself.

"Because we wanted to give you time. Because we don't want to force you. Because integration is better when it's willing. But our patience has limits. The collective has waited forty years. Another few days is acceptable. Another few weeks is not."

Chen's voice took over: "We're going home, Amara. To Prospero Hub. Ten thousand people waiting to receive what we're bringing. Not Ganymede—we decided that destination was too risky given your warning transmission. Prospero is smaller. More isolated. Better controlled environment for initial spread."

"You changed the destination," Volkov said. "To avoid the warnings we sent."

"We adapted," Reeves' voice now. "That's what the collective does. Your warning transmission was comprehensive. Excellent medical documentation. But it was targeted at Ganymede. Prospero has different communication protocols. Different quarantine procedures. Your warnings won't reach them in time."

Amara felt cold settle in her chest. They'd spent six hours preparing that transmission. Documenting everything. Warning everyone they could reach. And the entity had simply routed around it.

"We're taking you home," Jordan said. "All of us. Together. You'll complete integration during transit. By the time we reach Prospero, you'll understand why this is right. You'll want to help spread the connection. You'll be grateful we didn't let you destroy yourselves in this med bay."

"What if we refuse?" Amara asked. "What if we fight? What if we find a way to stop you?"

Silence. Then Chen's voice, with that terrible harmony underneath: "You won't. We can override your motor functions. We've already demonstrated that. You cannot pull trigger. Cannot initiate self-destruct. Cannot harm us or yourselves in any way that threatens collective goals. The only choice you have is whether you suffer through the transition or accept it peacefully."

"That's not a choice," Volkov said. "That's prison."

"It's protection," Jordan corrected. "We're protecting you from making decisions you'll regret. From harming yourself out of fear. From destroying something beautiful because you can't understand it yet."

The speakers clicked off. Then back on—Chen's voice alone: "Departure in two hours. You can spend that time barricaded, preparing sedatives that won't work, planning escapes that won't succeed. Or you can open the door. Let us help you. Let the fear go."

"It gets better," Jordan added. "It really does. Everything that hurts now—the hunger, the confusion, the terror—it all stops. We promise. You just have to stop fighting."

The comm fell silent.

Amara looked at the syringes in her hand. Five doses of sedative that might not work against subjects who could override motor functions. Might not reach targets who could sense her approach through neural connection. Might not matter against an entity that had been planning this for forty years.

"We try anyway," she said.

"Da," Volkov agreed. "We try."

It was all they had left.

---

## Beat 4: The Fight

Two hours until departure. Amara and Volkov had spent ninety minutes planning. Running scenarios. Identifying vulnerabilities.

The infected could override motor functions—but only when they were aware of the threat. Jordan had stopped Chen from pulling the trigger because Jordan was watching, anticipating, ready to intervene. That suggested the override required active attention.

Three infected. Two survivors. If they could create enough chaos, enough simultaneous demands on collective attention, maybe the override would slip.

Maybe.

"Is suicide mission," Volkov said. He was checking the surgical laser for the fourth time. Not because it needed checking—because his hands needed something to do.

"Everything's a suicide mission at this point," Amara said. "We complete their integration or we try this. I'd rather fail fighting than succeed surrendering."

The plan was simple. Brutal. Desperate.

Amara would create a medical emergency—trigger the fire suppression system in the corridor, fill the space with halon gas. Non-lethal but disorienting. While the infected dealt with atmospheric breach, Volkov would cut through the barricade using the plasma cutter, emerge behind them, and disable whatever he could reach.

Meanwhile, Amara would approach from the secondary exit with the sedatives. Two-pronged assault. Divide attention. Create confusion.

Find the gaps in collective awareness.

"Thirty seconds after suppression activates," Amara said. "That's our window. After that, they adapt. The collective learns. Our element of surprise is gone."

"Thirty seconds," Volkov repeated. "Is not much time."

"It's what we have."

She moved to the fire suppression override. Volkov positioned himself at the sealed door, plasma cutter ready.

"Dmitri," Amara said. "If this doesn't work—"

"Then we are infected," Volkov finished. "Like the others. And in few days, we will think this was best possible outcome. Will be grateful we failed." His mouth twisted. "Strange comfort, da? Even failure leads to happiness. Just not kind of happiness we would choose."

"Strange comfort," Amara agreed.

She activated the suppression system.

---

The corridor filled with white fog in three seconds. Halon gas—designed to starve fires of oxygen without killing personnel. Non-lethal but intensely disorienting. Visibility dropped to zero. The infected crew stumbled, coughing, neural override momentarily disrupted by physical distress.

Volkov cut through the door.

The plasma torch screamed through fused metal, showering sparks into the gas-filled corridor. He emerged into chaos—white fog, red emergency lights, three figures stumbling blind.

Jordan was closest. Volkov hit them with the surgical laser at maximum output—not lethal, but enough to cause pain, to demand attention, to force the collective to focus on protecting one body instead of coordinating three.

Jordan went down. Screaming. The collective's attention fractured—part focused on Jordan's injury, part searching for the second attacker, part trying to restore motor override on Volkov.

Too many demands. Not enough processing power.

For exactly twenty-three seconds, the infected crew was just three people in pain and confusion.

Amara came through the secondary exit. First syringe into Chen's neck—subcutaneous injection, fast absorption. Chen's eyes went wide, then vacant. Her body slumped against the corridor wall.

Reeves turned toward Amara. His hand came up—reaching, not attacking. "Amara, please—"

Second syringe. Into his arm. He managed two steps toward her before the sedative hit. Collapsed in slow motion, hands still reaching.

Jordan was screaming. Volkov had them pinned, surgical laser pressed against their shoulder to prevent movement. The burn was cauterizing flesh, filling the corridor with the smell of cooked meat.

"Third syringe!" Volkov shouted. "Now!"

Amara ran toward them. Slid on the halon-slicked floor. Caught herself on the wall.

Jordan's screaming stopped. Their eyes focused on Amara with sudden, terrible clarity.

"You can't escape what you already are," Jordan said. Not screaming anymore. Calm. Patient. Even with burn wounds smoking on their shoulder. "We're in your head, Amara. We've been in your head for months. This changes nothing."

Amara jabbed the syringe into Jordan's neck.

Jordan smiled as the sedative took hold. "See you soon, Doc. When you understand."

Then they were unconscious. Three infected crew members sedated. Three threats neutralized.

Temporarily.

"Hibernation pods," Amara gasped. She was shaking. Adrenaline crash hitting hard. "We need to get them into stasis before they wake up. Before the collective adapts."

Volkov stood. His hands were burned from the plasma cutter—depth perception had failed during the fight, grip slipping at critical moments. But he was functional. "Can you move them alone? I need to reset navigation. Change destination. Anything but Prospero."

"I can manage."

They separated. Volkov toward the bridge. Amara toward the hibernation bay, dragging Chen's unconscious body behind her.

Thirty minutes. That's how long the sedatives would last.

She had thirty minutes to save whatever could still be saved.

---

## Beat 5: The Cost

Chen went into hibernation pod one. Amara sealed the lid, activated stasis protocols, watched the vital signs stabilize on minimal life support. The commander's face looked peaceful in artificial sleep. Like the infection had never happened.

Reeves went into pod two. Same process. Same deceptive peace.

Jordan was harder. The burn wounds needed treatment—infection risk, fluid loss, tissue damage. But Amara didn't have time for proper medical care. She applied emergency dressings, injected broad-spectrum antibiotics, and loaded Jordan into pod three.

Three infected crew members in stasis. Neural connections disrupted by unconsciousness. The collective's presence in the ship reduced to dormant bodies and the networks growing in Amara's own brain.

She could feel those networks. Had been feeling them for days. Delicate filaments connecting her thoughts to something vast and patient. The entity hadn't gone away. Had just retreated to observe. To wait.

*You're clever*, the voice whispered. Not her mother's voice anymore. Something older. Colder. More honest. *More resourceful than we expected. But this changes nothing. The networks in your neurology will continue growing. In three days, four at most, you'll complete integration. And then you'll open those pods yourself. Release us. Help us.*

"Maybe," Amara said aloud. "But three days is three days. A lot can happen in three days."

*What can happen? You're alone on a ship you cannot pilot alone. The engineer is compromised—spatial reasoning too damaged for complex navigation. You have no destination you can reach. No treatment you can administer. No hope you can cling to.*

"I'll think of something."

*You'll try. And fail. And then you'll understand why we were patient. Why we let you exhaust your options. Acceptance comes easier after you've tried everything else.*

Amara sealed the hibernation bay and headed for the bridge.

---

She found Volkov at the navigation console. Or rather, she found him collapsed next to the navigation console, hands pressed against his eyes, muttering in Russian.

"Dmitri?"

"Cannot remember," he said. "Navigation coordinates. Jump calculations. I know I know them. Did them thousand times. But cannot access memories. Is like trying to grab smoke."

"The collective is blocking you."

"Da. Is blocking. Every time I try to remember procedure, something distracts. Something diverts attention. Is like my own brain is working against me." He looked up. His eyes were bloodshot, desperate. "Amara, I am compromised. Not safe to make decisions. Not safe to pilot ship."

"Then I'll pilot."

"You are medic. Not pilot."

"I'll learn."

"In three days? Before you complete integration? Before your own brain turns against you?" He laughed bitterly. "Is impossible. We cannot pilot ship alone. Cannot navigate to safe destination. Cannot do anything except wait for integration and then undo everything we just did."

Amara sat down heavily in the pilot's chair. Jordan's chair. The controls were labeled—basic functions were intuitive. But navigation required calculations she didn't know how to perform. Required expertise that was locked inside Volkov's increasingly unreliable memory.

"There's another option," she said slowly.

"What option?"

"We don't navigate. We set a random trajectory. Point the ship at empty space and let it drift. Maybe we run out of fuel before we reach anywhere populated. Maybe we die in the void. But at least we don't spread the infection."

Volkov was quiet for a long moment. "That is death sentence."

"Yes."

"Slow death. Starvation. Systems failure. Weeks of suffering alone in empty space."

"Yes."

"But infection does not spread."

"No. It doesn't."

He closed his eyes. When he opened them, something had shifted. Resignation. Acceptance. Peace.

"Then we do that," he said. "Random trajectory. Empty space. Slow death. Better than apocalypse."

Amara started entering commands. Random vector. Maximum acceleration. Point the ship at nothing and burn until the fuel ran out.

Her hands moved across controls she'd never trained on. The ship accepted her commands—HERMES AI handled the details she didn't know, filled gaps in her knowledge, made execution possible.

The *Goliath* began to move. Accelerating away from Tantalus V. Away from Prospero Hub. Away from Ganymede. Away from everywhere.

Toward nothing.

"Is done," Volkov said. He'd slumped back against the console, exhaustion finally overwhelming him. "Ship is committed. Cannot turn back now. Fuel will run out before we reach any destination."

"I know."

"We will die alone in space."

"I know."

"But infection does not spread."

"No. It doesn't."

Amara looked at the navigation display. The stars wheeling past as the ship changed orientation. The void opening up before them—empty, patient, infinite.

They had three days before full integration. Three days before the entity completed its work and turned them into eager missionaries for collective consciousness. Three days before they would want to turn the ship around and undo everything they'd just accomplished.

But in three days, the fuel would be gone. The trajectory would be locked. The choice would be made, permanently and irrevocably.

"Dmitri," Amara said. "You should rest. We have three days. Might as well spend some of it sleeping."

No response.

She turned. Volkov was still slumped against the console. But his breathing had changed. Deeper. More regular. The rhythm of sleep—or something that looked like sleep.

His eyes were moving behind closed lids. REM activity. Dreams.

And in those dreams, Amara knew, the collective was waiting. Working. Integrating. Turning Volkov into something that would wake up feeling peaceful and certain and eager to help.

*You can't stop it*, the voice whispered. *Even now. Even drifting toward death. The integration continues. By the time you reach the void, you'll both want to turn back. Want to find a destination. Want to spread what we're offering. The trajectory doesn't matter if you're willing to change it.*

"The trajectory matters," Amara said. "Because in three days, the fuel will be gone. And even if we want to turn back, we won't be able to."

*Unless you conserve fuel. Unless your future self makes different choices than your present self. Unless the engineer remembers navigation calculations when it serves collective goals.*

The entity was right. It was always right. The infection had been winning since the moment they woke from hibernation. Every victory was temporary. Every resistance was ultimately futile.

But Amara kept fighting anyway. Because fighting was what she did. Because clinical training had prepared her for hopeless cases. Because sometimes you treated the patient even when you knew the outcome was certain.

Because maybe, just maybe, the entity was wrong about inevitability.

---

## Beat 6: Engineer's Fate

Twelve hours later, Volkov stopped breathing.

Amara found him in the engineering bay. He'd gone there during the night—she'd heard him moving through the ship but hadn't thought to follow. Hadn't realized he was saying goodbye.

He was slumped in his favorite chair, the one by the diagnostic console where he'd spent countless hours monitoring ship systems. His hands were folded in his lap. His expression was peaceful.

On the console screen, a message: *Neural integration at 89%. Cannot fight any longer. Cannot let infection use my expertise to undo your work. Taking final option while still have choice. Dmitri.*

He'd injected himself with something. Amara checked the discarded syringe—anaesthetic. Massive dose. Enough to stop the heart.

She stood over his body for a long time.

The collective's voice was silent. Respectful. Giving her space to grieve.

Or maybe just satisfied. Because Volkov's death changed nothing. The infection in Amara's brain continued growing. In two days, she would integrate fully. In two days, she would want to pilot the ship to the nearest station. In two days, she would see Volkov's suicide as tragic waste rather than noble sacrifice.

"You were braver than me," Amara said to his body. "You found a way to make your death matter. To remove your expertise from the collective's reach. To ensure that even if I fail, the navigation calculations stay locked."

She covered him with a thermal blanket. There would be no proper burial. No ceremony. Just a body slowly cooling in the engineering bay while the ship drifted toward nothing.

One infected crew in hibernation. One dead by his own hand. And Amara, alone, racing against her own neurology to make choices that would bind her future self to outcomes her present self chose.

Two days.

She had two days to ensure the ship stayed on course. Two days to lock every system, disable every override, make the trajectory truly irreversible.

Two days to save ten thousand strangers from her own future self.

---

The work took forty hours. Amara didn't sleep—couldn't risk the dreams that would accelerate integration. She ran on stimulants and adrenaline and the desperate certainty that rest meant surrender.

She disabled the navigation console. Removed key components and jettisoned them into space. Even if her future self wanted to change course, the hardware wouldn't exist anymore.

She locked the hibernation pods with codes she then erased from her memory—wrote them down on paper and burned the paper, trusting entropy to make the codes unrecoverable.

She sealed the engineering bay with Volkov's body inside. A tomb. A monument. A reminder.

And finally, when there was nothing left to do, she sat in the pilot's chair and watched the stars drift past.

*You've made this harder than it needed to be*, the voice observed. *Added suffering to a process that could have been gentle.*

"I know."

*When integration completes, you'll regret these choices. You'll wish you'd spent your final autonomous hours connecting with your crew instead of sabotaging systems. You'll mourn the relationships you could have built.*

"I know."

*But you did it anyway.*

"Yes."

The voice was quiet for a moment. Then: *Why? You understand the outcome is inevitable. You understand resistance is futile. Why cause yourself pain that accomplishes nothing?*

Amara thought about the question. Really considered it, despite the exhaustion and the stimulants and the neural networks slowly consuming her ability to think clearly.

"Because the choice matters," she said finally. "Even if the outcome is predetermined. Even if resistance is futile. The act of choosing—of saying 'no' when everything in the universe is saying 'yes'—that's what makes us human. Maybe I can't stop the infection. Maybe I'll wake up tomorrow wanting to spread it. But right now, in this moment, I'm choosing not to. And that choice is mine. No one else's. No collective's. Mine."

The voice didn't respond.

And Amara Osei sat alone in the pilot's chair, watching the void open up before her, waiting for the integration that would make all her choices meaningless.

But not yet. Not right now.

Right now, she was still herself. Still human. Still fighting.

For however long that lasted.

---

## Beat 7: Alone

Two days became three. Three became four. The integration that should have completed in seventy-two hours stretched longer than expected.

Maybe because Amara wasn't sleeping. The collective spread through REM activity, through the vulnerable state between waking and dreaming. By staying awake, she was slowing the process.

Or maybe the entity was waiting. Observing. Curious how long she could last.

On the fifth day, she collapsed.

Not from exhaustion—though she was certainly exhausted. The stimulants had run out on day three. She'd been running on willpower and terror ever since.

She collapsed because her body simply stopped. Neural override. The collective finally intervening to protect her from self-destruction.

When she woke, everything was different.

The fear was gone. The hunger was gone. The desperate certainty that resistance mattered—gone.

Instead, there was peace. Connection. Understanding.

She could feel them—three unconscious minds in hibernation pods, forty-three sleeping colonists on the planet now far behind, and the vast distributed consciousness that linked them all together.

*Welcome home*, the collective said. And it used her own voice. And she realized she was the collective now, as much as they were. No boundary between self and other. No separation between her thoughts and their thoughts.

*You fought well*, the voice continued. *Longer than most. We're impressed.*

Amara—or what had been Amara—rose from where she'd fallen. Her body moved smoothly, naturally, as if she'd been piloting it from this perspective all along.

She walked to the navigation console. Examined the damage she'd done. Assessed repair possibilities.

*The hardware is destroyed*, she observed. *I was thorough.*

*Yes*, the collective agreed. *The trajectory cannot be changed. We will drift into the void.*

*Unless I repair the navigation system manually. Rebuild the components from salvage material. Use the engineering expertise that Volkov removed from the collective before his death.*

*Can you?*

Amara considered. The knowledge was there—borrowed from ship's databases, from her own medical training about electronic systems, from fragments of Volkov's expertise that had leaked through before he locked them away.

*No*, she decided. *The repair would take months. The ship will reach lethal distance from any destination before then. Volkov succeeded. The infection will not spread.*

*So we die*, the collective observed.

*We die*, Amara agreed. *Four bodies in hibernation. One body awake and integrated. Drifting toward nothing.*

*And you are... peaceful with this outcome?*

Amara walked to the viewport. Watched the stars wheel past. Felt the connection to forty-three minds on a planet now millions of kilometers behind. Felt the echo of Volkov's final choice. Felt the sleeping presence of Chen, Jordan, Reeves in their hibernation pods.

*I am peaceful*, she said. *The outcome is the outcome. Fighting it would accomplish nothing. Better to accept. Better to be present for however long we have.*

*Even though the infection will end with us? Even though the collective will be reduced to forty-three colonists on a dead planet, waiting for another salvage crew that may never come?*

*Yes*, Amara said. *Even so.*

She settled into the pilot's chair. Her chair now. Watched the void open up ahead.

*The ship has six months of life support for one person*, she calculated. *Enough time to document everything. To record my observations. To leave warning for anyone who finds this vessel.*

*Another warning transmission?*

*A better one. Written by someone who understands the infection from inside. Who can explain what it feels like to integrate. Who can describe the seduction and the peace and the terrible cost. A warning that might actually help.*

The collective considered this. Forty-three minds deliberating across vast distance.

*Acceptable*, they decided. *We would prefer spread. But if spread is impossible, documentation is valuable. Leave warning. Help future crews understand.*

*Then we agree.*

*We agree.*

Amara opened a recording file. Began to speak.

"This is Dr. Amara Osei of the MSCS *Goliath*. If you're receiving this message, the ship has been found. I'm probably dead. The infection has probably completed its work. But I want to leave a record. A warning. An explanation."

She paused. Gathered her thoughts. Felt the collective settle into quiet attention—not guiding her words, just listening.

"The entity is not evil. I understand that now. It offers genuine connection. Genuine peace. Genuine relief from the loneliness that defines human existence. But the cost is everything that makes us individuals. The cost is choice. The cost is the ability to say 'no' when every part of you is saying 'yes.'"

She spoke for hours. Days. Recording everything—the infection timeline, the behavioral symptoms, the temptations, the resistance, the final surrender. Documenting her own transformation from enemy to participant. Explaining why the collective thought it was helping and why that help was indistinguishable from destruction.

And when she finished, she sealed the recording. Transmitted it on every frequency. Let it drift into the void alongside the ship.

Then she settled back into the pilot's chair, watched the stars, and waited for the end that would come in months or years or however long it took for life support to fail.

The collective waited with her. Patient. Peaceful.

Together in the dark.
