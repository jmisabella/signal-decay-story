# Current Story Arch

This document outlines the overall structure and key elements of the story "Signal Decay," based on the latest updates in CHANGE_LOG.md. The story is a dark sci-fi narrative about a crew infected by an alien consciousness during a deep-space mission, with integration planned for the Z Rooms app (featuring chapters, poems, ambient audio, and text-to-speech).

## Core Premise
A small deep-space survey crew of corporate contractors awakens from hibernation to investigate a decades-old distress beacon from a failed colony. Upon waking, they experience disturbed dreams that blur self and other, foreshadowing the planet's viral entity that edits minds into a collective. The infection spreads subtly, leading to paranoia, manipulation, and vampiric adaptations.

## Hibernation Hook (Updated)
Hibernation is not dreamless but filled with vivid, wrong-feeling dreams: shared imagery, memories of being someone else, and sensations of unity. The ship's AI logs anomalies (erratic brainwaves), creating paranoia about compromise during sleep. This primes the crew for the entity's influence and heightens fear of returning to hibernation.

## Characters (To Be Developed)
- 4-5 distinct crew members: Expendable contractors with unique personalities, skills, and losses from hibernation (e.g., memory gaps, personality shifts).
- Ship AI: Clinical observer of behavioral changes.
- The Entity: Ancient, patient consciousness that views individuality as a disease.

## Story Structure

### Act 1: Awakening and Investigation
- Crew wakes from hibernation, haunted by disturbed dreams.
- They land on the planet, exploring the colony: Evidence of social breakdown turning methodical and wrong (found footage of "evolution" discussions).
- Subtle infection begins: Intrusive thoughts, certainty in doubt, lost time.

### Act 2: Escalation and Infection
- One crew member infected, sabotages subtly (e.g., equipment failures).
- Manipulation: Infected gaslights others, referencing shared dreams as "signs" to stay and study.
- Behavioral tells emerge: Seeking proximity, UV intolerance, telepathic erosion.

### Act 3: Revelation and Climax
- Discovery: Hibernation systems compromised pre-launch; corporate sent them knowingly.
- Full infection reveals vampiric traits (physical contact for spreading, night vision).
- Choice: Return to hibernation (risking further change) or endure conscious isolation.

## Ending Options
- Bleak: Survivor returns home, spreads infection undetected.
- Bleaker: All infected, plot to spread to inhabited systems.
- Ambiguous: Survivor hesitates to destroy ship, doubt lingers.

## Narrative Style
- Fragmented, non-linear: Perspectives from crew (including infected), audio logs, AI reports, entity transmissions.
- Chapters: Standalone but connective; poems as entity philosophy or corrupted human works.
- Themes: Loss of self vs. belonging, corporate exploitation, horror of continuity.
