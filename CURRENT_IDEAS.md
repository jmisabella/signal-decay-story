# Current Ideas

This document compiles key ideas, themes, mechanics, and unresolved questions from CHANGE_LOG.md, organized by category. It reflects the latest updates, including the shift from dreamless hibernation to disturbed dreams.

## Hibernation and Awakening
- Disturbed dreams: Vivid, wrong-feeling visions of shared imagery, alien memories, unity sensations. Creates paranoia about compromise during sleep.
- Anomalies: Ship AI logs erratic brainwaves; crew wakes with memory gaps, personality shifts, lost skills.
- Fear: Returning to sleep risks further erosion of self.

## Infection Mechanics
- Subtle onset: Intrusive thoughts feeling native, sudden certainty, lost time.
- Progression: Telepathic communication as boundary erosion; vampiric adaptations (UV intolerance, physical contact for spreading, enhanced senses).
- Detection: Behavioral tells (seeking proximity, microexpressions); mimics human behavior perfectly initially.

## The Entity and Planet
- Ancient viral consciousness: Edits minds into collective; views individuality as disease.
- Colony fate: Colonists "evolved" into conduits; immortal hive nodes?
- Scope: Planetary/galactic? Emergent collective or singular intelligence.

## Themes and Symbolism
- Loss of self vs. belonging: Infection offers connection, relief from loneliness/doubt.
- Corporate exploitation: Crew as disposable probes; betrayal in sending knowingly.
- Horror of continuity: "Which version was real?" Ego death as rehearsal.
- Vampire/contact spreading: Intimacy as contamination; hibernation as parasitic.

## Narrative and Structure
- Fragmented audio: Crew perspectives (pre/post-infection), logs, AI reports, entity transmissions.
- Randomization: Chapters standalone but connective; poems as alien philosophy or corrupted works.
- Inspiration: Planet of the Vampires, Severance, Pluribus (malicious spread).

## Unresolved Questions
- Character details: Who are the 4-5 crew? Distinct traits and losses?
- Entity voice: Overlapping voices? Calm alien philosophy?
- Specific scenes: Key chapters/beats?
- Poetry content: Entity transmissions? Descriptions?
- Timeline: Colonists "alive" for decades—immortal? Resource needs?
- Motivation: Infected manipulates protectively; what keeps crew from leaving?
- Ending implications: Scope affects stakes.
