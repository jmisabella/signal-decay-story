### Critical Locations (Detailed)

---

#### **Bridge / Command Center**
**Location**: Forward section, deck 1

**Features**:
- Commander's station (tactical overview)
- Pilot's nav console (Jordan's primary station)
- Communications array
- Main viewscreen (external cameras, no "windows")
- Ship AI interface terminal
- Emergency bulkhead controls

**Atmosphere**: Utilitarian. Dim blue lighting. Hum of active systems. Cramped but organized.

**Travel Time From**:

- Med Bay: 2 minutes through central hub
- Engineering: 3 minutes
- Cargo Bay: 4 minutes

---

#### **Crew Quarters**
**Location**: Deck 2, just aft of bridge

**Layout**:
- 5 individual berths (3m x 2m each) - tiny but private
- Shared head/bathroom (water recycling)
- Personal storage lockers
- Emergency escape pod access (currently 2 pods functional)

**Chen's Quarters**:
- Photo of Liam on small shelf
- Meticulously organized
- Military precision in arrangement

**Volkov's Quarters**:
- Tools scattered but in organized chaos
- Schematic printouts on walls
- Half-drunk coffee cups (chronic)

**Amara's Quarters**:
- Medical texts on tablet
- Small plant (fake, but she talks to it anyway)
- Photos of family in Accra

**Jordan's Quarters**:
- Navigation star charts
- Music collection (Earth nostalgia)
- Messiest of the five

**Reeves's Quarters**:
- Xenoarchaeology texts
- Salvage manifests
- Spartan, emotionally sterile

---

#### **Medical Bay**
**Location**: Deck 3, port side of central hub

**Equipment**:
- Diagnostic scanner (neural imaging, full body scan capability)
- Surgical station (rarely used for more than stitches)
- Medicine dispensary (locked, Amara has access)
- Quarantine isolation pod (single person, can be sealed from outside)
- Medical records terminal

**Atmosphere**: Sterile white surfaces, harsh LED lighting, smell of antiseptic

**Amara's Domain**: This is where she discovers infection through scans, monitors crew vitals, and eventually realizes everyone is compromised

---

#### **Central Hub / Common Area**
**Location**: Deck 3, center of ship

**Features**:
- Corridor intersection (connects all major sections)
- **UV Sterilization Field** (crosses main corridor - important for infection tells)
- Emergency equipment lockers
- Ship AI announcement speakers
- Status displays (ship health, life support, warnings)

**The UV Corridor**:
- 8-meter stretch with UV sterilization emitters
- Standard route between quarters and engineering/cargo
- Infected crew avoid this route (flinch, take longer path through cargo bay)
- Chen notices this pattern first

---

#### **Galley / Mess Hall**
**Location**: Deck 3, starboard side of central hub

**Features**:
- Food synthesizer (reconstitutes ration packs)
- Water dispenser (recycled, always tastes slightly metallic)
- Small eating area (table seats 6, usually only 3-4 use it)
- Nutrient storage
- Coffee maker (Volkov's most-used equipment)

**Atmosphere**: Utilitarian but attempts at homey - crew has added small personal touches over missions. Where crew socializes, where Amara suffers taste aversion visibly.

---

#### **Engineering Bay**
**Location**: Deck 4, aft section

**Equipment**:
- Main reactor access and controls
- Life support management systems
- Diagnostic terminals
- **Tool storage** (Volkov's organized chaos)
- **Coolant system access** (sabotage target Chapter 4)
- **Navigation computer backup** (sabotage target Chapter 4)

**Volkov's Domain**: Where he makes errors, suspects sabotage, fights declining spatial reasoning

**Critical Systems**:
- Coolant circulation (if this fails, reactor overheats)
- Environmental controls (oxygen, temperature, pressure)
- Ion drive management
- Power distribution

---

#### **Cargo Bay & Salvage Hold**
**Location**: Deck 5, large open area

**Contents**:
- Previous mission salvage (still being transported)
- Equipment for surface operations (suits, scanners, containers)
- Excavation tools
- Sample containment units
- **Alternative route around UV corridor** (longer path through cargo racks)

**Atmosphere**: Cavernous, echo-y, dim lighting except work zones. Cluttered but organized in Volkov's system.

---

#### **Hibernation Bay**
**Location**: Deck 6, isolated section

**Equipment**:
- 8 hibernation pods (5 currently in use)
- Monitoring station
- Ship AI hibernation protocols
- Emergency revival systems

**Pods**:
- Individual sealed units
- Nutrient IV systems
- Neural monitoring (records dreams/brain activity)
- Temperature control (near-freezing)

**Compromised Systems**: Entity accessed hibernation systems during outbound journey, infected crew through neural interface. Ship AI logged anomalies but didn't wake crew.

**Chapter 6 Use**: Amara places infected crew back in hibernation here as final act of resistance.

---

#### **Engine Room**
**Location**: Deck 7, stern section (aft-most)

**Equipment**:
- Ion drive manifolds
- Fuel cell storage
- Reactor shielding access
- Emergency venting controls

**Access**: Restricted, requires engineering authorization. Loud, hot, dangerous. Rarely visited during normal operations.

---

## Ship Systems (Plot-Relevant)

### Navigation Computer
**Location**: Bridge and Engineering backup
**Function**: Calculates trajectories, stellar positioning, course corrections
**Sabotage**: Jordan corrupts coordinates in Chapter 4, making crew think recalculation takes 48 hours
**Reality**: Navigation functional, infected buying time

### Coolant System
**Location**: Engineering, runs through entire ship
**Function**: Keeps fusion reactor from overheating
**Sabotage**: Jordan damages coolant line in Chapter 4 while "helping" Volkov
**Symptoms**: Engine running hot, requires "repair" time (actually buying time for infection spread)

### UV Sterilization Fields
**Location**: Central hub main corridor
**Function**: Kills bacteria and viruses in high-traffic area
**Infection Tell**: Infected flinch/avoid these fields (UV damages infection somehow)
**Plot Use**: Chen and Amara notice Jordan always takes cargo bay route instead

### Ship AI: "Hermes"
**Name**: HERMES (Heuristic Emergency Response Management & Evaluation System)
**Personality**: Clinical, helpful but emotionless, not true AGI
**Function**: Ship diagnostics, emergency protocols, logging, life support management
**Limitations**: Can't override corporate lockout codes, can't wake crew without specific triggers

**AI Logs**: Records anomalies but doesn't interpret meaning. Becomes evidence of:
- Hibernation neural activity during outbound journey
- Unauthorized system access during sleep
- Behavioral baseline deviations post-wake
- Corporate sealed file decryption at mission coordinates

### Corporate Lockout Systems
**Function**: Prevents mission abort without proper authorization
**Codes Required For**:
- Early departure (requires complete salvage assessment)
- Quarantine protocol override
- Emergency beacon activation (crew distress)
- Hibernation initiation without proper sequencing

**Plot Impact**: Crew can't just leave. Economic and legal chains keep them grounded until infected want them to leave.

## Colony Site: Tantalus V

### Planet Overview
**Name**: Tantalus V (designation, not official name)
**Type**: Rocky terrestrial, marginally habitable
**Atmosphere**: Breathable but thin (requires acclimatization)
**Gravity**: 0.87 Earth standard
**Climate**: Cold, dry, minimal weather
**Day/Night Cycle**: 31 Earth hours

**Colonization**: Established 40 years ago as mining/research outpost. Population: 147 at peak. Went silent after 18 months. Distress beacon reactivated 6 months ago (mystery).

---

### Surface Colony Layout

#### **Surface Structures** (Chapter 2 Exploration)
**Condition**: Too neat for 40-year abandonment
- Habitat pods arranged in geometric patterns (concentric circles)
- Personal belongings arranged symmetrically outside dwellings
- No decay, no chaos, no signs of panic
- Everything organized with wrong intentionality

**Wrongness Indicators**:
- Furniture moved into patterns that don't serve human function
- Tools arranged by size rather than use
- No bodies, no remains, no evidence of evacuation violence

---

#### **Underground Facility** (Chapter 2 Discovery)
**Location**: 200 meters below surface, accessed via intact elevator shaft

**Structure**:
- Main chamber (~50m diameter)
- Hibernation pods arranged in spiral pattern (not standard grid)
- 43 colonists in pods, vital signs active (impossible - supplies ran out decades ago)
- Lighting still functional (dim, emergency power)
- Atmosphere: Cold, stale, but breathable

**The Entity's Presence**:
- Not visible, but felt
- Atmosphere/spores in air (telepathic infection vector)
- Colonists are hosts, sustained by entity
- When Jordan touches colonist, infection completes

**Found Footage Location**: Terminal in facility, logs dated from colony establishment through Day 540

---

## Worldbuilding Context

### Post-Disaster Earth
**Disaster Type**: Never explicitly named (deliberate ambiguity)
**Indicators**:
- Economic collapse ~70 years before story
- Mass migration to stations and colonies
- Earth still inhabited but resource-depleted
- Inner colonies (Mars, Ganymede, Europa) established but struggling

**Current State**:
- Corporate entities control most infrastructure
- Work is scarce, salvage is necessary industry
- Multiple colony waves failed over past century
- Death rates high, life is cheap

---

### The Salvage Economy
**Corporate Structure**:
- Mining & Salvage Consortium (MSC) - largest employer
- Contracts are binding, penalties severe
- Crews are independent contractors, not employees
- Death benefits minimal, replacement workers plentiful

**Salvage Missions**:
- Assess failed colonies for tech recovery
- Determine what went wrong (corporate risk assessment)
- Recover valuable equipment, data, research
- Death rate: 15-20% per mission
- Pay: Mediocre base + bonuses for valuable finds

**This Mission Contract**:
- Base pay: 6 months salary for completion
- Bonus potential: 20% for tech recovery, 40% for determining cause of failure
- Abort penalty: 18 months salary
- Insurance: Minimal, only covers catastrophic ship loss

#### **Mars Colonies**
- Where Jordan's parents live (Mariner Valley settlement)
- Aging infrastructure, low-gravity health issues
- First-generation immigrant communities

#### **Earth**
- Mentioned but never shown
- Volkov's mother lives in Kyiv hab-complex
- Post-disaster recovery, resource-depleted
- High gravity makes return difficult for long-term space residents

## Technology Level

### What Exists
✅ Hibernation pods (long-duration suspended animation)
✅ Fusion reactors (ship power)
✅ Ion drives (sublight propulsion)
✅ Ship AI (not true AGI, more like advanced automation)
✅ Neural monitoring (brain activity scanning)
✅ Medical scanners (full body diagnostic, neural imaging)
✅ Synthetic food (reconstituted rations, not great)
✅ Recycled water and air (closed-loop life support)

### What Doesn't Exist
❌ FTL travel (journeys take months/years)
❌ True AGI (AI is sophisticated but not conscious)
❌ Replicators (food is reconstituted, not created)
❌ Teleportation
❌ Gravity manipulation (ships use rotation or acceleration for artificial gravity)
❌ Perfect medical tech (injuries and conditions still serious)

### Limitations Matter
- Communication lag across solar distances (no instant contact with home)
- Resources are finite (fuel, food, oxygen carefully managed)
- Equipment breaks and repairs are difficult
- Medical treatment is limited to what's on board
- No backup, no rescue if something goes wrong
